  abstract = {This paper starts by describing the structure of the London Millennium Footbridge. The bridge opened on 10 June 2000. During the opening day unexpected lateral movements occurred as pedestrians crossed the bridge. The paper describes the events of opening day and the research and analysis that were carried out as a result of these movements. The lateral force exerted by pedestrians on the moving deck surface is found to be related to the movement. The results show that the phenomenon is not related to the technical innovations of the bridge and that the same phenomenon could occur on any bridge with a lateral frequency below about 1.3Hz loaded with a sufficient number of pedestrians. A selection of other bridges, including one road bridge, found to have exhibited the same phenomenon, are listed. The paper describes the development of a retrofit to control the vibrations. This involves the use of fluidviscous dampers and tuned mass dampers to achieve damping levels in excess of 20{\%} of critical. The results of tests on the bridge with a prototype installation of a small number of the proposed dampers are presented, which show that the performance of the damping scheme conforms with analytical predictions.},

  abstract  = {This classic textbook by J. P. Den Hartog, retired professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, reflects the author's unique ability to combine the scholarly insight of a distinguished scientist with the practical, problem-solving orientation of an experienced industrial engineer. Although mathematics plays a role in the subject, Den Hartog employs the simplest possible mathematical approaches. His lucid explanations of complex problems are presented in a direct style and supported by illustrative models. Numerous figures in the text enhance its value as a basic foundation in a field which Den Hartog calls "a necessary tool for almost every mechanical engineer." The author examines such topics as the kinematics of vibration (including harmonic motions and non-harmonic periodic motions), degrees of freedom, gyroscopic effects, relaxation oscillations, Rayleigh's method, natural frequencies of torsional vibration, Karman vortices, and systems with variable elasticity. Drawing on his experience as an engineer in private industry and in the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ships, Den Hartog applies theory to practice, discussing the effects of vibrations on turbines, electrical machines, helicopter rotors and airplane wings, diesel engines and electrical transmission lines. As a special aid to classroom work or self-study, this practical text includes an extensive selection of 233 problems and answers that test the student's mastery of every section of the book. In addition, a highly useful Appendix contains "A Collection of Formulas" for determining the load per inch deflection of linear springs, the load per radian rotation of rotational springs, the natural frequencies of simple systems, the longitudinal and torsional vibration of uniform beams, the transverse or bending vibrations of uniform beams, and the vibrations of rings, membranes, and plates. When Mechanical Vibrations was first published in 1934, it was a pioneering work in a field which had just been introduced in America's technical schools. In fact, the author wrote it to assist him in teaching the subject at Harvard. "During the life of the book," he says, "from 1934 on, the art and science of engineering has grown at an astonishing rate and the subject of vibration has expanded with it." Professor Den Hartog's constant revisions have kept his book at the forefront of this vital subject, as useful today as its earlier versions were to students of the past.},

The criterion used to obtain the optimum parameters is to select, for a given mass ratio, the frequency (tuning) and damping ratios that would result in equal and large modal damping in the first two modes of vibration. The parameters are used to compute the response of several single and multi-degree-of-freedom structures with TMDs to different earthquake excitations. The results indicate that the use of the proposed parameters reduces the displacement and acceleration responses significantly. The method can also be used in vibration control of tall buildings using the so-called ‘mega-substructure configuration’, where substructures serve as vibration absorbers for the main structure. It is shown that by selecting the optimum TMD parameters as proposed in this paper, significant reduction in the response of tall buildings can be achieved.},

  abstract = {Although the incidence of floor vibration problems appears to be on the rise, the use of mechanical damping devices to control vibrations is limited. In a recent survey of vibration control methods, Murray reports that passive-mechanical damping methods, including viscous damping, visco-elastic damping, and tuned-mass dampers, have often gone untried outside the laboratory or have had marginal impact in actual buildings. This is particularly unfortunate because mechanical dampers can sometimes control floor vibrations more cheaply than structural stiffening, and are often the only viable means of vibration control in existing structures. This paper details the successful implementation of a tuned-mass damping system to reduce the steady-state vibrations of the longspan, cantilevered, composite floor system at the Terrace on the Park Building in New York City. The experience with this implementation suggests that tuned mass dampers (TMDs) can be successfully employed to control steady-state vibration problems of other composite floor systems. The potential for general application of TMDs in composite floor systems is discussed, and areas for further research are suggested.},

  abstract = {Abstract A nonstationary stochastic process, having statistical characteristics similar to actual earthquakes, was developed using a random signal generator and an analog computer. Dynamic models of multistory structures were also programmed on analog computer circuits to obtain many simulations in a relatively short period of time. The dynamic behavior of multistory seismic structures, with the addition of low-cost passive motion reduction devices, was studied using the analog simulation. It was demonstrated that such devices as (a) an absorber attached to the roof (b) a nonlinear spring between the foundation and structure, and (c) a damping mechanism at the first floor can be extremely effective in reducing the seismic response and thus the probability of failure of a multistory structure.},
